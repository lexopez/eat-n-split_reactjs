# 💸 Split Bill – Simple React App

**Split Bill** is a very simple **React.js** learning project that allows users to split expenses with friends and track who owes whom. The app is intentionally minimal and implemented entirely in a **single file (`App.js`)**, using only **local state (`useState`)**.

This project focuses on understanding React fundamentals rather than production-level architecture.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The app lets users:

- View a list of friends
- See balances (who owes who)
- Add new friends with an avatar
- Select a friend and split a bill
- Update balances based on who paid

All logic, UI, and state handling are contained in one file for simplicity and learning purposes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS** for styling

⚠️ No Context API, Redux, backend, or external libraries are used.

This project demonstrates:

- Using `useState` for managing application state
- Handling multiple pieces of state in a single component
- Passing values and handlers within the same file
- Controlled form inputs
